# California Housing Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook explores various techniques to build an effective model for predicting housing prices based on available attributes in the California housing dataset. The goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate house prices by utilizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:janneheldan/house-price-prediction-ml.git
cd house-price-prediction-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab house_price_prediction.ipynb
```
