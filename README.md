# California Housing Price Prediction
<br>
This Jupyter Notebook explores various techniques to build an effective model for predicting housing prices based on available attributes in the California housing dataset. The goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate house prices by utilizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Contents

- Data Exploration: Investigating the dataset and understanding the features that influence house prices.
- Model Building: Applying different machine learning models and evaluating their performance based on RÂ² and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) scores.
- Feature Engineering: Enhancing the model by applying techniques such as feature scaling, encoding, and transformation.
- Evaluation: Comparing the models based on their performance metrics and selecting the best one.
